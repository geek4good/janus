Janus
=====

I've customized Janus with a nice colorscheme, a couple of plugins and a
few key bindings. The following sections elaborate on those.

## Colorscheme

* badwolf (https://github.com/sjl/badwolf)

## Plugins

* TODO: Add some plugins

## Key bindings

### Insert mode

* Map `<j><j>` to `<esc>`
